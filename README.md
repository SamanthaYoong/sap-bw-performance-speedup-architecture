# Optimizing Global Sales Reporting with SAP BW/4HANA for Faster Decision-Making

**Candidate:** Samantha Yoong 
**Role Applied:** Junior Business Intelligence Analyst – BW  
**Industry:** Global B2B manufacturing & construction supply  
**Tech & Skills:** SAP BW/4HANA, Data Modelling, ETL, ABAP (basics), SQL, Tableau, Stakeholder Collaboration

---

## TL;DR (Why this matters)
- **Problem:** Large volumes + fragmented models slowed reports → decisions lagged by **4–5 business days**.  
- **Goal:** **Speed + timeliness** — optimize BW models for **faster queries** and enable **near real-time** updates for critical KPIs.  
- **Outcome:** <24h monthly close reporting, **2-hour** refresh for critical KPIs, **65%** runtime reduction, **0** Excel stitching.

---

## Background

In a global manufacturing company operating across 80+ countries, sales leaders struggled with **inconsistent** and **delayed** performance reporting.

The SAP BW landscape consumed data from multiple regional ERPs, but:
- Data models were **not standardized** across regions.  
- Sales KPIs required **manual Excel consolidation**.  
- **Large data volumes slowed report generation**, causing monthly reporting to take **4–5 business days**, delaying strategic decisions.

**My mandate:** review the existing reporting process, identify bottlenecks, and deliver a **faster, scalable, standardized** solution in **SAP BW/4HANA**.

---

## Objectives

1. Reduce monthly sales reporting time from **4–5 days** to **< 24 hours**.  
2. **Standardize KPI definitions** for global alignment.  
3. Enable **self-service reporting** for regional managers.  
4. **Optimize BW data models** for faster query performance and introduce **near real-time** reporting for business-critical KPIs.

##  Actions Taken

### 1) Stakeholder Requirement Gathering
- Interviewed regional sales managers, finance reporting team, and IT leads from **APAC, EMEA, and North America**.  
- Identified **12 core sales KPIs** (e.g., Net Sales, Gross Margin %, Order Fill Rate) to be standardized globally.  
- Clarified calculation logic differences between regions and secured **alignment on single definitions**.

### 2) Data Model Review & Gap Analysis
- Audited existing **SAP BW InfoProviders** and **CompositeProviders** used in the current reports.  
- Found **duplicate data flows** from different ERP sources causing redundancy and mismatches.  
- Noted some transformations were **hard-coded in ABAP routines** instead of being parameterized, slowing performance.

### 3) BW/4HANA Data Model Optimization for Speed
- Consolidated regional data flows into **one global CompositeProvider** with leaner joins and only necessary fields.  
- Introduced **Open ODS Views** for near-real-time data loads from SAP S/4HANA, enabling updates to key KPIs multiple times per day.  
- Replaced hard-coded ABAP logic with **calculated key figures** in BW queries to reduce runtime and simplify maintenance.  
- Performed query performance testing, reducing **average load time by 65%**.

### 4) Reporting Enablement
- Developed **BEx Query Designer** reports linked to optimized BW data models with drill-down by **region, product line, and time**.  
- Integrated **Tableau dashboards** on top of BW queries for visual insights and trend analysis.  
- Created a **global reporting template** to ensure KPI and layout consistency.

### 5) Process Automation
- Implemented **process chains** for scheduled nightly data loads.  
- Set up **alerting mechanisms** for load failures to ensure uninterrupted reporting availability.
